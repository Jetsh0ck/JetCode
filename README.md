Hi! Thanks for taking your time in reading this!

You are probably here for one of my projects so, you can use them for anything as long as you don't claim it as yours!

I am new to creating datapacks so I'd appreciate if you could tell me any errors i'm currently doing so that I can improve my work in the future!
